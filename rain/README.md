Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

 

<h3>Example 1:</h3>
<div>
 <img src="images/rainwatertrap.png" width=450px height=170px>
</div>

Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]<br>
Output: 6<br>
<h4>Explanation</h4>: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain waterh (blue section) are being trapped.
